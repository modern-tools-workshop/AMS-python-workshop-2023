It demonstrates how to work with a VIIRS Level 2 (granule) netCDF4 file, including how to handle a netCDF4 file that organizes data variables into **groups** and what aspects to consider for making a beautiful image of point data.\n",

    "\n",
    "Now that we have created our map of fire detections, we need to save the image file so we can use the image in a research paper, presentation, website, or social media.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "We can extract information from the satellite data file name to automatically generate a file name for the saved file, including the observation date and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can change the resolution of the saved image file using the ```dpi=``` argument in ```fig.savefig()```. The higher the dpi, the higher the figure resolution, but the larger the file size and the longer it will take to save the file. For figures that include an image map background, like this one, set a very high dpi, such as ```dpi=1000```, so the details of the map background will be clear. *Use a lower ```dpi``` value if you are running this Notebook in the **Binder** cloud platform, to avoid crashing.*\n",
    "\n",
    "We can also set the ```facecolor``` (background color) for the plot, and I like to set ```bbox_inches='tight'``` to minimize the bounding box around the figure (to zoom in \"tight\" on the plot).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we can also specify the format for the saved file (```saved_file_format```). The default is a .png file, but **Matplotlib** has many options. Try saving your image file with a different format, such as .jpg or .pdf, to see the differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Matplotlib** saved file format options: .eps, .jpeg, .jpg, .pdf, .pgf, .png, .ps, .raw, .rgba, .svg, .svgz, .tif, .tiff\n",

    "By default, the image file is saved to the \"current working directory\", where this Notebook file is located.\n",
    "\n",
    "**This is the final step! Comments are included in the code below, to notate each step in the process of generating a beautiful image of VIIRS Level 2 point satellite data.**"
