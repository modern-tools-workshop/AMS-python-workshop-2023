    "\n",
    "This tutorial was written in December 2022 by Dr. Rebekah Esmaili, STC at NOAA/JPSS (rebekah.esmaili@noaa.gov) and Dr. Amy Huff, IMSG at NOAA/NESDIS/STAR (amy.huff@noaa.gov). It demonstrates how to work with an ABI Level 2 netCDF4 file, including how to work with the ABI fixed grid/GOES Imager projection and what aspects to consider when making beautiful composite color (RGB) imagery.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main steps are:\n",
    "- Open the file\n",
    "- Read the global file metadata & the metadata for variables in the file\n",
    "    - Recognize the GOES Imager fixed grid projection variables\n",
    "- Combine ABI band data variables to make different types of composite RGB imagery\n",
    "- Plot composite RGB imagery using the native geostationary map projection\n",
